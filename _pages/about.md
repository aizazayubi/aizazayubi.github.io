I am a research-focused engineer working on **Speech Technology, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning**, with a particular emphasis on **low-resource languages** and **LLM-integrated speech systems**.

My work spans **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**, **NLP**, and **applied Large Language Models**, where I focus on building practical, research-driven systems rather than purely theoretical models. I am especially interested in improving speech and language technologies for underrepresented languages.

I have hands-on experience with:
- Low-resource ASR systems  
- NLP pipelines and hate speech detection  
- LLM-based agents and retrieval-augmented systems  
- Speech–LLM integration for real-world applications  

I am actively seeking **PhD opportunities** in Speech, NLP, and AI, where I can contribute to research on speech understanding, multilingual systems, and trustworthy language technologies.
